# ðŸ§  PhishGuard AI â€“ Hybrid Machine Learning System for Email Phishing Detection  

## Overview  
**PhishGuard AI** is a powerful hybrid system that detects phishing emails using both **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning techniques**.  
The system extracts features from email content and metadata (sender, subject, URLs, and timestamps) and classifies whether an email is **legitimate** or **phishing**.  

This project is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, with custom preprocessing and feature-engineering pipelines for maximum flexibility and interpretability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
- Detect phishing emails using **classification and anomaly detection** models.  
- Engineer features from email metadata (sender, domain mismatch, subject, URLs).  
- Train multiple ML models and evaluate their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
- Provide a **Streamlit web app** for real-time email classification.
